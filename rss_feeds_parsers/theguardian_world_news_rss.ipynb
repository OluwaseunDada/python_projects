Richard Ratcliffe called for a meeting with the next prime minister and demanded the incoming government stand up for British citizens unjustly held abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British-Iranian woman started her third hunger strike against her continued imprisonment in Iran on Saturday. She had vowed to take action if she was still in jail on their daughter Gabriella’s fifth birthday.

Some are tourists, here to gawp and take selfies, but others are customers. Adverts for clubs flash and sing and girls dressed as maids hold signs offering deals for local bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a grubby shopfront a perky cartoon featuring a cute Mr Men-style creature offers part-time work. The ad, which has an alarmingly catchy jingle, doesn’t specify what the work is, but it doesn’t need to: the answer is all around us on the brightly lit billboards advertising the charms of male and female bar hosts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/15/tokyo-pink-bus-campaign-seeks-to-protect-schoolgirls-from-escort-scouts-jk-business\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       "<description>&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years people have come to Sanya in search of labouring jobs, shelter and a sense of belonging – but the area is changing fast, and its residents are struggling to adapt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first sight, Sanya looks much like any other Tokyo suburb: well-appointed homes, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. In the distance, soaring above the rooftops and mesh of overhead power lines is the unmistakable shape of the Tokyo Skytree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its proximity to the ultra-modern landmark is deceptive. Older men in well-worn tracksuits, baseball caps and plastic slippers clutch cans of early-afternoon &lt;em&gt;chu-hi&lt;/em&gt; alcopops, and dozens of no-frills hostels advertise rooms with easily the lowest rates in the city – clues to Sanya’s status as a Tokyo neighbourhood like no other, but one that is struggling to adapt to irresistible change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/the-tokyo-neighbourhood-where-people-come-to-disappear\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       "<description>&lt;p&gt;Novel wheeze to profit from packed trains latest in long line of creative ways to deal with Tokyo’s long commutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning, millions of Tokyoites cram into overcrowded trains across the &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/10/tokyo-big-year-is-the-impenetrable-city-finally-opening-up\"&gt;world’s largest city&lt;/a&gt;. Most must stand, often squeezed uncomfortably together. So, earlier this month, one enterprising commuter came up with a novel wheeze to profit from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His morning journey ran from the suburb of Chiba into central Tokyo – a long trip for which he was almost always guaranteed to get a seat. So he put that seat up for auction – for 2,000 yen (£14.50). He named the car, and the time of the train, and asked buyers to show him proof of payment on their mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/game-of-thrones-commuter-sells-seat-on-crowded-tokyo-train\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       "<description>&lt;p&gt;You could argue that the world’s biggest city has hit a sweet spot: a flatlining population, pervasive transit and little gentrification. But is ‘peak city’ even possible – and where does Tokyo go from here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo is often described as crowded, mushrooming, figuratively bursting at the seams. Except, in many ways, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many megacities, the world’s largest metropolitan area has largely stopped growing, either in land or population. Where Mumbai, Lagos or São Paulo continually sprout new informal neighbourhoods that are constantly outstripping the ability of the city to catch up, Tokyo’s urban planning and services more or less seamlessly encompass the central wards and the neighbouring cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Chiba and Saitama that form its unbroken metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/has-tokyo-reached-peak-city\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

The year before, Zeffirelli had directed Richard Burton and Liz Taylor in another Shakespeare adaptation: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL9jeaZxttY\"&gt;The Taming of the Shrew&lt;/a&gt;: clever casting of course, but it was the honeyglow-sunlit romanticism of young love in Romeo and Juliet — not cynical middle-aged love — which caught the public imagination, tuned into the zeitgeist and gave Zeffirelli his massive hit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/15/franco-zeffirelli-romeo-and-juliet\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       " <description>New UK research predicts extremes of weather will hit food production&lt;p&gt;Global heating could bring many more bouts of severe drought as well as increased flooding to Africa than previously forecast, scientists have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research says the continent will experience many extreme outbreaks of intense rainfall over the next 80 years. These could trigger devastating floods, storms and disruption of farming. In addition, these events are likely to be interspersed with more crippling droughts during the growing season and these could also damage crop and food production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/14/africa-global-heating-more-droughts-and-flooding-threat\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

Richard Ratcliffe called for a meeting with the next prime minister and demanded the incoming government stand up for British citizens unjustly held abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British-Iranian woman started her third hunger strike against her continued imprisonment in Iran on Saturday. She had vowed to take action if she was still in jail on their daughter Gabriella’s fifth birthday.

       " <description>&lt;p&gt;The persistent practice of paying underage girls for sex-related services, known in Japan as the ‘JK’ business, has seen charities step in where police have come up short&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a humid Wednesday night the streets of Kabukicho, Tokyo’s most famous red light district, hum with people. Some are tourists, here to gawp and take selfies, but others are customers. Adverts for clubs flash and sing and girls dressed as maids hold signs offering deals for local bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a grubby shopfront a perky cartoon featuring a cute Mr Men-style creature offers part-time work. The ad, which has an alarmingly catchy jingle, doesn’t specify what the work is, but it doesn’t need to: the answer is all around us on the brightly lit billboards advertising the charms of male and female bar hosts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/15/tokyo-pink-bus-campaign-seeks-to-protect-schoolgirls-from-escort-scouts-jk-business\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       " <description>&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years people have come to Sanya in search of labouring jobs, shelter and a sense of belonging – but the area is changing fast, and its residents are struggling to adapt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first sight, Sanya looks much like any other Tokyo suburb: well-appointed homes, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. In the distance, soaring above the rooftops and mesh of overhead power lines is the unmistakable shape of the Tokyo Skytree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its proximity to the ultra-modern landmark is deceptive. Older men in well-worn tracksuits, baseball caps and plastic slippers clutch cans of early-afternoon &lt;em&gt;chu-hi&lt;/em&gt; alcopops, and dozens of no-frills hostels advertise rooms with easily the lowest rates in the city – clues to Sanya’s status as a Tokyo neighbourhood like no other, but one that is struggling to adapt to irresistible change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/the-tokyo-neighbourhood-where-people-come-to-disappear\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       " <description>&lt;p&gt;Novel wheeze to profit from packed trains latest in long line of creative ways to deal with Tokyo’s long commutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning, millions of Tokyoites cram into overcrowded trains across the &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/10/tokyo-big-year-is-the-impenetrable-city-finally-opening-up\"&gt;world’s largest city&lt;/a&gt;. Most must stand, often squeezed uncomfortably together. So, earlier this month, one enterprising commuter came up with a novel wheeze to profit from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His morning journey ran from the suburb of Chiba into central Tokyo – a long trip for which he was almost always guaranteed to get a seat. So he put that seat up for auction – for 2,000 yen (£14.50). He named the car, and the time of the train, and asked buyers to show him proof of payment on their mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/game-of-thrones-commuter-sells-seat-on-crowded-tokyo-train\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

       " <description>&lt;p&gt;You could argue that the world’s biggest city has hit a sweet spot: a flatlining population, pervasive transit and little gentrification. But is ‘peak city’ even possible – and where does Tokyo go from here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo is often described as crowded, mushrooming, figuratively bursting at the seams. Except, in many ways, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many megacities, the world’s largest metropolitan area has largely stopped growing, either in land or population. Where Mumbai, Lagos or São Paulo continually sprout new informal neighbourhoods that are constantly outstripping the ability of the city to catch up, Tokyo’s urban planning and services more or less seamlessly encompass the central wards and the neighbouring cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Chiba and Saitama that form its unbroken metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/has-tokyo-reached-peak-city\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

The year before, Zeffirelli had directed Richard Burton and Liz Taylor in another Shakespeare adaptation: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL9jeaZxttY\"&gt;The Taming of the Shrew&lt;/a&gt;: clever casting of course, but it was the honeyglow-sunlit romanticism of young love in Romeo and Juliet — not cynical middle-aged love — which caught the public imagination, tuned into the zeitgeist and gave Zeffirelli his massive hit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/15/franco-zeffirelli-romeo-and-juliet\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

These could trigger devastating floods, storms and disruption of farming. In addition, these events are likely to be interspersed with more crippling droughts during the growing season and these could also damage crop and food production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/14/africa-global-heating-more-droughts-and-flooding-threat\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

      "<description>&lt;p&gt;The persistent practice of paying underage girls for sex-related services, known in Japan as the ‘JK’ business, has seen charities step in where police have come up short&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a humid Wednesday night the streets of Kabukicho, Tokyo’s most famous red light district, hum with people. Some are tourists, here to gawp and take selfies, but others are customers. Adverts for clubs flash and sing and girls dressed as maids hold signs offering deals for local bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a grubby shopfront a perky cartoon featuring a cute Mr Men-style creature offers part-time work. The ad, which has an alarmingly catchy jingle, doesn’t specify what the work is, but it doesn’t need to: the answer is all around us on the brightly lit billboards advertising the charms of male and female bar hosts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/15/tokyo-pink-bus-campaign-seeks-to-protect-schoolgirls-from-escort-scouts-jk-business\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

      "<description>&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years people have come to Sanya in search of labouring jobs, shelter and a sense of belonging – but the area is changing fast, and its residents are struggling to adapt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first sight, Sanya looks much like any other Tokyo suburb: well-appointed homes, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. In the distance, soaring above the rooftops and mesh of overhead power lines is the unmistakable shape of the Tokyo Skytree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its proximity to the ultra-modern landmark is deceptive. Older men in well-worn tracksuits, baseball caps and plastic slippers clutch cans of early-afternoon &lt;em&gt;chu-hi&lt;/em&gt; alcopops, and dozens of no-frills hostels advertise rooms with easily the lowest rates in the city – clues to Sanya’s status as a Tokyo neighbourhood like no other, but one that is struggling to adapt to irresistible change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/the-tokyo-neighbourhood-where-people-come-to-disappear\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

      "<description>&lt;p&gt;Novel wheeze to profit from packed trains latest in long line of creative ways to deal with Tokyo’s long commutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning, millions of Tokyoites cram into overcrowded trains across the &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/10/tokyo-big-year-is-the-impenetrable-city-finally-opening-up\"&gt;world’s largest city&lt;/a&gt;. Most must stand, often squeezed uncomfortably together. So, earlier this month, one enterprising commuter came up with a novel wheeze to profit from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His morning journey ran from the suburb of Chiba into central Tokyo – a long trip for which he was almost always guaranteed to get a seat. So he put that seat up for auction – for 2,000 yen (£14.50). He named the car, and the time of the train, and asked buyers to show him proof of payment on their mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/game-of-thrones-commuter-sells-seat-on-crowded-tokyo-train\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

      "<description>&lt;p&gt;You could argue that the world’s biggest city has hit a sweet spot: a flatlining population, pervasive transit and little gentrification. But is ‘peak city’ even possible – and where does Tokyo go from here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo is often described as crowded, mushrooming, figuratively bursting at the seams. Except, in many ways, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many megacities, the world’s largest metropolitan area has largely stopped growing, either in land or population. Where Mumbai, Lagos or São Paulo continually sprout new informal neighbourhoods that are constantly outstripping the ability of the city to catch up, Tokyo’s urban planning and services more or less seamlessly encompass the central wards and the neighbouring cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Chiba and Saitama that form its unbroken metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/14/has-tokyo-reached-peak-city\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

The year before, Zeffirelli had directed Richard Burton and Liz Taylor in another Shakespeare adaptation: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL9jeaZxttY\"&gt;The Taming of the Shrew&lt;/a&gt;: clever casting of course, but it was the honeyglow-sunlit romanticism of young love in Romeo and Juliet — not cynical middle-aged love — which caught the public imagination, tuned into the zeitgeist and gave Zeffirelli his massive hit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/15/franco-zeffirelli-romeo-and-juliet\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

      "<description>&lt;p&gt;Money and power are the cornerstones of exploitation, and rich donors have both. No wonder saints have become sinners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a year since the allegations of &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti\"&gt;sexual abuse in Haiti&lt;/a&gt; were revealed, Oxfam has been through the equivalent of a reality TV colonoscopy: the organisation has been turned inside out and upside down to reveal what lurks beneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent investigation on sexual misconduct found abuse far beyond Haiti. The independent commission’s conclusion, after visiting 20% of countries where Oxfam works, was that the issues were endemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/12/oxfam-hypocrisy-not-unique-aid-system-built-on-power-imbalance\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\n",

      "<description>&lt;p&gt;Iran’s leaders have shown their intent to defend their interests by damaging those of their foes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of this year, two beliefs have held firm in the halls of power in Iran: US attempts to strangle its economy cannot be tolerated and &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/donald-trump-us-war-iran\"&gt;Donald Trump has no intention of going to war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from wilting under the barrel of a global superpower’s guns, Iran’s leaders have signalled an intent to defend their interests, by damaging those of their foes. Iran’s anger at the US, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/15/iran-us-divisions-deepen-over-gulf-of-oman-oil-tankers-attack\"&gt;its alleged role in the attacks on six tankers in Gulf &lt;/a&gt;waters over the past five weeks did not emerge from a vacuum.
